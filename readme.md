# PDF-INVENTORY
Admittedly a bit of a misnomer, this project will create a static web page with a list of your ebooks and pdfs, 
and really any other files you might want to list.

The table in the site can filtered by searching titles, and will list any file of any type you provide for it.

It started as a way to organize a growing collection of ebooks, and ended up being a somewhat versatile project, even in it's unpolished state.
